                            <p>One by-product of two consecutive Oscar wins is that Tom Hanks no longer has to appear in such potboilers as Turner and Hooch.

When Turner leaves Hooch in the car outside the police station and Hootch begins to "eat" the head rest, the foam insert is a white, cylindrical shaped piece of padding. When Turner returns to the car, you can see that the headrest has changed to a standard, yellowish foam commonly used in that make and model automobile.
